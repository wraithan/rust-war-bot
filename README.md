# rust-war-bot

This is to be my next generation entry into the [Warlight 2 AI Challenge](http://theaigames.com/competitions/warlight-ai-challenge-2). Once I have a bot working, I'll split out the base framework needed to get going and submit it to [The AI Games](http://theaigames.com).

I'll be exploring various techniques in rust while I build this out. As this may end up being the first project I finish in rust.

## tests

This bot uses the same framework as my other bot [ZenWarBot](https://github.com/wraithan/zenwarbot) which was pioneered by [Curious Attempt Bunny](http://curiousattemptbunny.com/) in his [Clojure Bot]((https://github.com/curious-attempt-bunny/warlight2-starterbot-clojure)). You can find the spec for them [here](https://github.com/curious-attempt-bunny/warlight2-starterbot-clojure#create-new-tests).

## using my bot

I ask that if you do base your bot off mine, that you strip some/most of the logic out and build up your own. Pulling mine, making and incremental change and resubmitting it would be a bit lame. I am leaving it open source for others to learn how I structure it, since rust is a newer language and we could all use as much help as we can get.
